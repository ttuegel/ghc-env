* DONE Implement ghc-env in Haskell

* TODO Allow to hide core libraries

* TODO Use packages from all-cabal-hashes

* TODO Use packages from non-Hackage sources

* TODO Crib options from Rien

- Nixpkgs lock file
- GHC versioning

* TODO Shell environments

Saving the GHC environment file is a cute trick, but does not support foreign dependencies or other build tools. We will need to support actual nix-shell-based environments.
